<p>
Please note that for the form example the current url specified as the action routes to a server, accessable from anywhere within MCECS that is currently hosting the site. This site currently has no working backend setup other then nginx, but a mysql and php backend will be added soon. The server can be accessed on the VPN by going to 10.218.129.140 I will be moving the server however as this is my personal machine in an unfirewalled wireguard tunnel. Being my personal machine, I can't garuntee it'll be up, but I do have plans to clone the frontend and backend code to 10.218.201.34 which should be more stable.
